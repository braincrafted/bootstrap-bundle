About
-----

BraincraftedBootstrapBundle is [Bootstrap, from Twitter](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) encapsulated in a [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) bundle.

**Fair Warning**: This is in a very early development stage. Currently there are only the required stylesheets, JavaScripts and icons included and I started to include the form styles as Twig templates.

Todo
----

- Form styles
- Navigation/Menu (using [KnpMenuBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpMenuBundle))
